# Homework #9

Choose the BeautifulSoup library or the Scrapy framework. Then perform scraping of the website http://quotes.toscrape.com. Your goal is to obtain two files: `qoutes.json`, in which you should place all information about quotes from all pages of the website, and `authors.json`, where you will find information about the authors of these quotes. The json files structure should be exactly the same as in the previous homework assignment. Execute previously written scripts to upload the json files to the cloud database for the obtained files. The previous homework should work correctly with the newly obtained database.

## Additional Task

Use the Scrapy framework for scraping. The crawler should be run as a single `main.py` script.
